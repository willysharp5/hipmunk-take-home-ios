hipmunk ios take home problem for IOS engineers


Here is a link with guidelines and instructions:
https://github.com/Hipmunk/hipproblems/tree/master/ios_hotelapp

If you run into a snag or it doesn’t feel like an appropriate level of work, please don’t hesitate to let me know. We expect people to spend about two hours on it, though of course if you’re having fun you’re free to do more!

The guidelines are:

* There is no time limit to when you start or how long it takes you
* Third party libraries are fine as long as I don’t have to do anything fancy to install them (I have Carthage and Cocoapods)
* Using example code from wherever is fine as long as you cite it
* If for whatever reason you don’t feel you can finish in an amount of time you’re comfortable with, just let us know and we’ll play it by ear
